# DebtCounterBot
Telegram bot for calculating debt between chat members

This bot helps to simplify the money issue between friends, colleagues or neighbors! Just add the bot to chat with two members, greet him and you can finally forget about writing debt list on pieces of paper or about forgiveness :)

[DebtCounterBot](https://t.me/DebtCounterBot) - working instance for test.

## Examples
+ Joint shopping list

Ordered groceries with a dorm roommate? Write out his products from the check through a new line and keep the balance.

+ You pay for everyone in a bar

Usually it will never happen that you'll get your money back without constant reminder. Write a list to chat and it will be saved until the next gathering.
